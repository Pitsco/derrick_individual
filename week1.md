# 5.3 Notes: Computing Bias

## Github Page Actions

**Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?**

* No, since I believe they just failed to account for the wide range of skin tones. They most likely didn't test this.

**How do you think this happened?**

*  I feel this occurred as a result of a lack of appropriate testing on people with darker complexion tones.

**Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?**

* It is damaging to individuals who are impacted, although it was not intended to be so, and its purpose was to be beneficial rather than harmful.

**Should it be corrected?**

* I do believe it should be corrected, as the population affected is excluded from the features of the program in the computer.

**What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?**

* I would try to fix it by running tests until darker skins coul dbe accounted for in the program's detection of faces.

# 5.4 Notes: Crowdsourcing

## Github Page Actions

**CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?

* A crowdsource idea might be to have one big collaborative github project/repo, where every team is working on a seperate part of a larger project, which would benefit the environment by pushing it out to family and friends and serving its purpose.

**What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?

* DNHS crowdsourcing is directing material and classes to better benefit the student majority. The final project could be better with crowdsourcing if we correctly display info based on our client.
