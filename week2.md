# Week 2: 5.5 and 5.6

## TPT 2.0 Legal and Ethical Concerns 5.5
Patent: Shows ownership. Can make money

Licence and Patent could have conflict. Licence that contains things from a Patent.

Free and open source: Freedom to edit and change it online. Less restriction

Licence: could be free or restricted to make money off of it. (Talk to sponsor about it)
* GPL Licence: If copied thing is free, what you release off the copy has to be free

### Github Page Action
1.When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.

MIT Licence:
* Anyone could edit software
* Commercial Use
* Distributes closed code versions
* Creater of code has no responsibility on what others do to it

GPL Licence:
* Anyone could edit software
* Patent Use
* Other people who used the original code MUST show where the code originated from
* Changes to the code must be documented

2. Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.

I chosed a MIT licence for my individual page and Team Project. This is because I believe that I wouldn't come back to this code after the school year has ended.

## TPT 2.0 Safe Computing 5.6
PII: Personal Identifiable Information

This that can go wrong with computing:
* Leaked information
* IP Address
* Malware
* Identity Theft
* Stalking
* Credit card information

Solution:
* 2 Factor Authentication

(Recommend Watch College Board 5.6 Video 2)

### Github Page Action
1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.

In my current team project, I've observed PII. Consider the contact us page. This area on our website contains information about my teammates' and sponsors' email addresses.

2. What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?

I believe that having my PII, such as my IP address, exposed could be harmful to me. However, some information, such as my personal name, is something I'm comfortable disclosing.

3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.

Uppercase and lowercase characters, digits, symbols, and a password that isn't easily guessed make up a decent password. A good example would be D3rr1cKh10302006!

Short and predictable passwords are bad. Password is a good example.

Another step to assist in authentication would be having 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) or adding a sign in question to ensure that it is acutally you who is signing in.

4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.

Symmetric Encryption: A key that can encrypt and decrypt data in the same way.

Encryption with two keys is asymmetric. One is used to encrypt data, while the other is used to decrypt it.

5. Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment

When we need to update our website to the most recent version, encryption is an example of deployment. When we update the website, it will prompt us for a password in order to protect the website's data.

6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.

A phishing strategy that occurred to me resulted in a bot logging into my account and sending the same message that hacked my account to everyone I know. I updated my password right away and it stopped sending messages to people. Another phishing approach is to send them emails informing them that they have won an award and that they only need to supply some information to redeem it.
