### **Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing.**

**Beneficial:**

* Connect with society

Computers help keep you connected with long-distance friends and family over e-mail and social networking. People can use programs like Gmail or Skype to connect with millions of other people who share the same interests. Connecting to people worldwide is also an excellent way to meet people you would usually never meet.

Another great thing about communication on the Internet is that it's fast compared to other forms of communication. For example, you could send someone an e-mail on the other side of the planet and have it arrive in less than a few minutes. Snail mail (postal mail) could take days or even weeks to arrive.

* Helps with Organization

A computer can use its stored information more efficiently than any other device. In our earlier example, we mentioned the ability to store thousands of books. Once those books are stored on a computer, they can be sorted into categories, alphabetized, and searched to find what you're looking for in a few seconds. Trying to find the exact text in a thousand books would take human months, if not years. More sophisticated AI (artificial intelligence) can also be designed to make even more intelligent decisions. For example, there is computer software designed to help screen for cancers. Computers can scan through millions of possible signs of cancer and give a positive or negative result in less than a few minutes. Scientists are also using computers to help invent new methods of curing diseases with protein sequence pattern matching.

* Can store vast amounts of information and reduce waste

Computers are capable of storing and accessing vast amounts of information. For example, a computer and devices like eBook readers can store hundreds or thousands of books, given enough storage capacity. By storing books, documents, movies, pictures, and songs digitally, you can quickly find what you need by searching and sharing information between devices. It eliminates the need for paper used to make non-digital versions of the media.
