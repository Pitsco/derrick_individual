<h1> 5.1 Notes: Beneficial and Harmful Affects </h1>

<a>
  
* People create computing innovations
  
* Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
  
* A single affect can be viewed as both beneficial or harmful by different people or the same person

* An effect is such as a drone

  <h3> Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing </h3>

  **Beneficial:**

* Connect with society

   Computers help keep you connected with long-distance friends and family over e-mail and social networking. People can use programs like Gmail or Skype to connect with millions of other people who share the same interests. Connecting to people worldwide is also an excellent way to meet people you would usually never meet. 

* Helps with Organization

   A computer can use its stored information more efficiently than any other device. Information can be sorted into categories, alphabetized, and searched to find what you're looking for in a few seconds. The computer can store information like a store, but it is a faster way for the users to track their information. 

* Can store vast amounts of information and reduce waste

   Computers are capable of storing and accessing vast amounts of information. For example, a computer and devices like eBook readers can store hundreds or thousands of books, given enough storage capacity. By storing books, documents, movies, pictures, and songs digitally, you can quickly find what you need by searching and sharing information between devices. It eliminates the need for paper used to make non-digital versions of the media.

  **Harmful:**
  
* Relationships and Social Skills Issues
  
  Everyone is affected by negative effects of internet. For example, kids who use mobile devices daily become addicted to the internet world more and more and don't spend enough time with their family and/or friends. They are more likely to be virtually connected with friends, sharing photos and texting online than actually meeting them in person.
  
* Health Problems
  
  
  
* Online Dangers
