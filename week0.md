<h1> 5.1 Notes: Beneficial and Harmful Affects </h1>
  
* People create computing innovations
  
* Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
  
* A single affect can be viewed as both beneficial or harmful by different people or the same person

* An effect is such as a drone

  <h3> Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing </h3>

  **Beneficial:**

* Connect with society

   Computers help keep you connected with long-distance friends and family over e-mail and social networking. People can use programs like Gmail or Skype to connect with millions of other people who share the same interests. Connecting to people worldwide is also an excellent way to meet people you would usually never meet. 

* Helps with Organization

   A computer can use its stored information more efficiently than any other device. Information can be sorted into categories, alphabetized, and searched to find what you're looking for in a few seconds. The computer can store information like a store, but it is a faster way for the users to track their information. 

* Can store vast amounts of information and reduce waste

   Computers are capable of storing and accessing vast amounts of information. For example, a computer and devices like eBook readers can store hundreds or thousands of books, given enough storage capacity. By storing books, documents, movies, pictures, and songs digitally, you can quickly find what you need by searching and sharing information between devices. It eliminates the need for paper used to make non-digital versions of the media.

  **Harmful:**
  
* Relationships and Social Skills Issues
  
  Everyone is affected by negative effects of internet. For example, kids who use mobile devices daily become addicted to the internet world more and more and don't spend enough time with their family and/or friends. They are more likely to be virtually connected with friends, sharing photos and texting online than actually meeting them in person.
  
* Health Problems
  
  The overuse of mobile devices can be harmful to childrenâ€™s health. The more they use mobile devices, the less physical activities they do. The problem is that playing games online is combined with snacking, substituting the balanced alimentation. As children spend more time in front of those screens, most of the time in the couch, less time they spend outside playing, running and burning off calories. Over time, those habits can lead to a significant weight gain.
  
* Online Dangers
  
  <h3> Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? </h3>
  
  Dopamine plays a role in how we feel pleasure. It's a big part of our unique human ability to think and plan. It helps us strive, focus, and find things interesting. Though, as we develop more and more dopamine, we start to get very addicted 

   <h1> 5.2 Notes: Digital Divide </h1>

* Poorer or rural areas in America and other countries may have less or little access to Technology

* Some countries may have different or restricted access, for instance China and USA may have divide in service allowed in their countries

* The "digital divide" refers to social, regional, and demographic differences in access to computing equipment and the Internet.

* Individuals and groups can be affected by the digital divide.

* Globally and regionally, the digital gap presents questions of equity, access, and influence.

* Individuals, organizations, and governments all have an impact on the digital divide.

<h3> How does someone empower themself in a digital world? How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? </h3>

Someone in the digital world could be able to empower themselves by looking for ways to participate in the digital world. Using school chromebooks, for example, if you don't have one, would provide you sufficient access to the digital world, and then getting more aware about technology in general would empower people.

<h3> Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? </h3>

Someone who is powerful can look for opportunities that people who aren't powerful can take advantage of. This would involve the chromebooks at Del Norte, and someone with authority could guarantee that everyone who does not have the best access to technology makes full use of the chromebooks.

<h3> Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? </h3>

There is red tape everywhere that prevents people from gaining digital empowerment, with the most significant barrier being a lack of funds to do so. Del Norte offers ways to get through this red tape by incorporating technology into classrooms and distributing chromebooks to students who have never had access to the internet before. Other sources also provide possibilities for the underserved, such as having a plethora of options for obtaining old and obsolete technology for empowerment, although this isn't available everywhere.
