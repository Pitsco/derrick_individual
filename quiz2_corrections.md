### I didn't answer some of the questions because I did not submit in time. 

# Quiz Corrections:
### Question 4
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89278326/164986473-b3e33ac1-a8a1-42cb-9218-d99cd19e65b6.png)

I got this question 4 because I didn't realize that even though some individuals lack access to computing devices, reducing the cost of these electronics may help reduce the digital divide for these individuals. In this case, the correct answer would be B because if people didn't have technology to apply for a government job, they wouldn't be able to get a job they may want. 

### Question 12
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89278326/164986521-34d07f83-2463-4102-b0d5-ab37a7317d8e.png)

The answer to this question is D because since the application could allow users to contribute descriptions and photographs of landmarks. I selected C and then I realized it was completely wrong because the answer I chose was related to data compression, not crowdsourcing. 

### Question 21
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89278326/164986598-c5339c58-18db-443f-8014-5d01b762f865.png)

 The answer I chose is D and it is not correct because storing personal data will increase the amount of personal information stored, which is likely to increase the need for encryption. Therefore, the answer would be A because the developers can use machine learning and data mining and thereby make improvements based on the users’ needs.
 
### Question 22
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89278326/164986660-1615c570-de8b-48d4-95c0-ad8585601fe8.png)

Since IPv6 addresses are longer than IPv4 addresses, speed doesn't apply to these addresses, therefore doesn't apply to this quesiton. On the other hand, the answer is B because IPv6 has more IP addresses, which allows more people to connect to the internet.

### Question 27
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89278326/164986787-202d1d46-9b88-46a1-a07c-dc1fcd093778.png)

The answer to this question is D and not C because incremental code verifies if there are any errors. Incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs can help programmers identify new errors that are introduced.

### Question 30
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89278326/164986906-b4d9ef3c-79cf-4149-af8c-8ca79d900942.png)

The answer is B and not C. The decimal value 75 is equal to 64 + 8 + 2 + 1, which is equal to 26+23+21+20, which is equal to the binary number 01001011. The decimal value 0 is equal to the binary number 00000000. The decimal value 130 is equal to 128 + 2, which is equal to 27+21, which is equal to the binary number 10000010.

### Question 35
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89278326/164987071-46227d63-6333-4932-8c6d-c199afeec95b.png)

I didn't answer this question but the correct answer is C because overflow errors occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of numbers that can be represented by a fixed number of bits.

### Question 38
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89278326/164987087-c99777dd-3e2f-446b-af51-bba7bf8d4193.png)

The correct answer is C because it will be a challenge to clean the data from the different counties to make the data uniform. The way pollution data is captured and organized may vary significantly from county to county.

### Question 42
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89278326/164987159-6b750386-06a0-4a41-9bcb-dbdde6a79d8d.png)

The correct answer is both B and C because cloud computing sites must consider security concerns in order to protect their users’ private data. Also, cloud computing fosters new ways to communicate and collaborate, allowing users to share files and tools easily.

### Question 43
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89278326/164987248-931977c3-ea2c-44dd-b7a6-e8240664c864.png)

The correct answer is C and not B because the given code segment initializes count to 1 and increments count at the end of the outer loop. This causes the robot to move 1 square forward, then rotate left, then move 2 squares forward, then rotate left, then move 3 squares forward, then rotate left, then move 4 squares forward, then rotate left. The robot ends in the lower-right corner of the grid, facing toward the top of the grid. This code segment initializes count to 0 and increments count at the beginning of the outer loop. Because count is initialized to 0 and then immediately incremented inside the loop, the inner loop iterates the same number of times for each iteration of the outer loop as in the given code segment. The robot ends in the lower-right corner of the grid, facing toward the top of the grid.

### Question 44

I didn't answer this question but the correct answer is C because while effective collaboration often benefits from a diversity of talents and perspectives, collaborators still need to develop strategies to resolve differences of opinion.

### Question 46
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89278326/164987300-4f38ed62-5e00-4350-b9d0-94919720ac34.png)

The answer to this questino is both B and C because as any user has the ability to edit articles, there will be many opportunities for people with different perspectives to contribute. Also, the online encyclopedia can be edited at any time, so it is easy to create or update articles as new information
becomes available.

### Question 47
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89278326/164987359-ed680100-5088-43b7-a81c-2c16127bd803.png)

The answer is A because the xs, indicating participants who are interested in the application, are clustered toward the top of the graph. This indicates that participants who read more were generally more likely to say they are interested in the application.

### Question 48
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89278326/164987400-57d7649f-9241-4d6f-92c5-f2533bc184a4.png)

The answer is A because lossless compression algorithms allow for complete reconstruction of the original data and typically reduce the size of the data.

### Question 49
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89278326/164987440-4396214d-9816-4b5f-9ec1-8876b53587bb.png)

Correct answer is C because the transformation is lossless because an encoded string can be restored to its original version. For example, Open quotation, percent, hash, underscore, hash, underscore, percent E, underscore, BEST, underscore, W, hash, H, close quotation can be restored to Open quotation, THIS, underscore, IS, underscore, THE, underscore, BEST, underscore, WISH, close quotation by replacing all instances of Open quotation, percent, close quotationwith Open quotation, T H, close quotation and by replacing all instances of Open quotation, hash, close quotation with Open quotation, I S, close quotation.

### Question 50

Last but not least, the answer is D because the average total points earned per student can be determined using the result of the total points calculation
for each student. The average increase in total points per student as a result of the score replacement policy can be determined by
calculating the differences between each student score before and after the replacement policy was applied. The proportion of students
who improved their total points as a result of the score replacement policy can be determined by comparing the midterm and final scores for each student with the result of the total points calculation.
