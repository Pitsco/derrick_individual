# Quiz Corrections:
### Question 28

I got this question wrong because in data compression, you can compress data (like a .zip) file that can store data at a smaller size and then can be opened up as a bigger file size. The answer would be D.

### Question 29

I got this question wrong because I did not realize that it displays the correct sum of 10. The correct answer is C since the variable sum is initialized to store the value of the first element of numList, and because the iteration block is a FOR EACH loop, the value of the first element is added to sum twice. Since the first element of the list is 0, adding this number to the sum does not affect the sum. A non-zero first element would give an incorrect result. In general, a single test case is not sufficient to confirm that a program works as intended. 

### Question 34

I got this question wrong because I did not realize that cybercriminals do not correlate with fault tolerance. The correct answer is is B because fault tolerance uses redundant routing to develop multing possible paths between devices in case of the presence of network failures. 

### Question 36

I got this question wrong because I did not realize that options B through D are not stored in the database. The database doesn't pertain to one's individual likes or the popularity of an item. Therefore, this leads to the correct answer of A because the database stores information on item identification numbers and quantities available.

### Question 50

I got this question wrong because I did not realize that by converting the red, green, and blue values in each pixel into a single number, information has been lost that cannot be restored. So instead, the answer would be C because if a negative of the original image is made, each RGB triplet value will be computed by subtracting the original value from 255. The original value can then be restored by subtracting the new value from 255. This process is lossless because the exact original can be restored.
